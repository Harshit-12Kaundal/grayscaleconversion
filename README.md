# 🎞️ CUDA Image Grayscale Converter

This project demonstrates how to convert a color image to grayscale using **CUDA** for parallel processing and **OpenCV** for image handling in C++.

## 📸 Description

This project takes an input image (`input.jpg`), processes it on the GPU using a CUDA kernel to convert it into grayscale, and saves the result as `output.jpg`.

### ✅ Grayscale Formula:

Gray = 0.299 * R + 0.587 * G + 0.114 * B

This formula converts RGB values to luminance (grayscale intensity) using perceptual weights.

## 📁 Files

- `main.cu`: Main source file with CUDA kernel and OpenCV integration.
- `input.jpg`: Input color image (should be in the same directory or modified accordingly).
- `output.jpg`: Grayscale image generated by the CUDA kernel.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- CUDA Toolkit (e.g., CUDA 11.x or higher)
- OpenCV (C++ version)
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support

## ⚙️ How to Build

Make sure CUDA and OpenCV are installed and available in your system paths.

### 🧱 Compile with `nvcc` 
```bash  
nvcc main.cu -o grayscale `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv4`

How to run

./grayscale
